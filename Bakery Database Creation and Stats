/*In this project, I created a database that contains data regarding products a bakery sells that includes information 
about the quantity of each product this bakery makes per day, the price of each product, the total amount of ingredients 
each product requires, and the total time it takes to produce each item. Then I issued 3 SELECT queries to order the 
products by price (highest to lowest), return the total amount of ingredients each product requires, and return which 5 
menu items are the most time consuming to produce.*/
